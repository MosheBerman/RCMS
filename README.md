RCMS
====

RCMS stands for Realty Content Management System, and it'ss a realty website that I began building in high school. 

I can't say that I was a PHP wizard back in 2008, but I am pretty proud of my obsessive commenting. Each file should have a fairly thorough changelog.

This was initially something I began working on for a neighbor, but then I got busier with schoolwork.
